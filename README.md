# Back-end setup

### Upgrading my Back-end skills
Here I want to prepare useful back-end setups streamlining my work and giving me more confidence when working on code less visible to user. Additionally, I've learnt how to set up multiple remotes and aliases (you can find this work on [heroku](https://damp-gorge-32231.herokuapp.com/)).

### Adding Passport
A robust back-end for future applications definitely needs a strong authentication. This is to say - we going to need a passport.
